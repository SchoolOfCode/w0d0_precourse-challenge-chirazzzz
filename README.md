# William Shakespeare tribute page

I chose to build a tribute page to William Shakespeare not because 
I think he's the greatest writer but because he's had the most influence 
on the English language. So many of his phrases are now standard English 
idioms. I can't think of anyone else who has had such a huge impact.

## Site info

This is an adaptation of an existing design that I created for the freecodecamp
challenge. I've tinkered around a little bit and added some details.

I'm not totally satisfied with the final outcome so here are some possible 
changes I might make in the future:

* Use CSS grid to reduce need for media queries and make Plays columns responsive
* Clean up HTML markup because I created the site then added freecodecamps ids 
  so it's currently quite messy
* Rethink the colour scheme and create and a light/dark mode
